This code sets up a simple web app that lets you ask questions about files (like PDFs, Word docs, or text files) stored on your computer. It reads the files, breaks them into smaller pieces, and turns those pieces into something a computer can understand and search through quickly. When you ask a question, it looks for the most relevant info in the files and then, using an AI model running on your computer, using ollama, to give you an answer.
